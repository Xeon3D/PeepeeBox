/*
 * PeepeeBox   A fork of 86Box that emulates the funworld Photo Play / I.G.O.
 *             arcade kiosk hardware, including its protection token.
 *
 *             The funworld I/O card.
 *
 *             An ISA card the cabinets carried, built around an NEC D71055C --
 *             an 8255-compatible PPI, so three 8-bit ports and a control
 *             register at base+3.  A ULN2003 drives what leaves the card
 *             (the coin acceptor's inhibit line, the counters, the lamps); a
 *             74HC14 conditions what arrives; a 74LS682 compares the address
 *             against an 8-way DIP switch, which is what makes the base
 *             address a setting rather than a constant.
 *
 *             Wired to it: a Coin Controls C120 validator on a 10-way IDC, and
 *             the two buttons behind the cabinet door -- one for the operator
 *             setup, one for the touchscreen calibration.
 *
 *             The C120's contract (its manual, section 4.2) is the part that
 *             constrains this: six *separate* accept lines, one per coin, each
 *             an open-collector NPN pulled **low** for 100 ms +/- 20% on a good
 *             coin.  The manual is emphatic that the host must see the line
 *             held, not merely edge-detect it -- "NOT LESS THAN 50 mS" -- so a
 *             coin here is a timer, not a flag poked and cleared.  Anything
 *             shorter is a coin the software will not count, and it would fail
 *             silently, which is the failure mode this cabinet specialises in.
 *
 *             Where it lives was not documented anywhere; the disk was asked
 *             instead.  Booting I.G.O. 7 with PEEPEEBOX_IO_PROBE=00 caught a
 *             resident program at segment 06FC writing control word **0x99** to
 *             **0x213** and then reading 0210 and 0212 and writing 0211 --
 *             which is an 8255 at base 0x210 with, decoded out of 0x99:
 *
 *                 mode 0 throughout, port A input, port B output,
 *                 port C input in both halves.
 *
 *             So the coins and the buttons arrive on A and C, and B is what
 *             drives the ULN2003 -- the acceptor's inhibit line, the counters
 *             and the lamps.
 *
 *             Which bit is which was then measured, one line at a time, against
 *             the operator setup's book-keeping page on an I.G.O. 6 rig: six
 *             coins on A6, A7 and C4..C7, four notes on C0..C3, and the two
 *             groups rest opposite ways round.  The map and the idle levels
 *             below carry the working; neither is a guess any more.

/* What the inputs read when nothing is happening.

   Two devices share this loom and they rest opposite ways round, which is what
   made every earlier reading of the card wrong.

   The six C120 coin lines rest **high**, and a coin pulls one **low** -- exactly
   what the validator's manual says its open-collector outputs do.  The four bill
   validator lines rest **low** and a note drives one **high**.  A0 (the setup
   button) and A1 (the CRC check) rest high, with the coins.

       port A  idle FF   A0 setup, A1 CRC, A6 A7 coins, A2..A5 nothing
       port B  output    never read
       port C  idle F0   C0..C3 the notes, C4..C7 coins

   How that was settled.  With everything rested low -- the old
   PEEPEEBOX_IO_IDLE=00 -- pulsing one coin line high booked a coin on *each of
   the other five*, while pulsing a note line booked its one note.  Six presses,
   six sets of five, and every set is the six coin channels minus one:

       A6 -> everything but 2.00       C4 -> everything but 0.10
       A7 -> everything but TOKEN 10   C5 -> everything but 0.20
                                       C6 -> everything but 0.50
                                       C7 -> everything but 1.00

   That is not six coin lines misfiring.  It is the software reading the port and
   booking every coin line it finds low -- finding five, because we were resting
   them all there, and the pressed line was the only one we had lifted.  So the
   coin a line carries is the one *missing* from its set, and the notes read
   correctly all along because they are the group we happened to be driving the
   right way up.  (Marcos, on the I.G.O. 6 rig, 2026-09-05.)

   It also disposes of the "one 100 ms hold books five coins" defect recorded in
   the research notes: never five counts of one coin, but one count on each of
   five other channels.  There is nothing wrong with the debounce.

   PEEPEEBOX_IO_IDLE=ff,ff,f0 overrides the three ports in order, for when some
   other image disagrees. */

   square wave and a spare ULN2003 output squaring away like that reads as a bank
   select.  It is not a bank select and it is not a square wave: **B7 is a
   mechanical coin counter**, and what looked like a free-running wave was the
   counter being driven five times per press, back when a press booked five
   channels.  The knob is gone with the theory. */

/* PEEPEEBOX_IO_HOLD=A2,A3 -- lines pinned to their asserted state for the whole
   run, on top of whatever the walk is doing.

   The walk clears every line to idle before each click, which is right for
   finding a pulse and wrong if some line has to be *held* for the pulse to mean
   anything -- an acceptor-enabled or acceptor-present signal, the sort of thing
   a validator loom carries alongside its accept lines.  Anything like that has
   been knocked down before every click so far.

   A2..A5 look like the candidates, being the lines that have never answered
   anything -- but note that until fwio_read_env() they were never tested
   individually either, so "A2..A5 must be enabling something" is a reading of a
   walk that was ignoring its own settings.  Try the pin first; this is for if

   B7 was excluded at first, on the ~3 Hz square wave recorded in the research

   A1 is very probably the touchscreen calibration button, on a count of wires
   rather than on anything seen on screen.  The card has two connectors: a DB25
   carrying the acceptor loom, which is the ten money lines above, and a DB15
   carrying two mechanical coin counters (outputs, through the ULN2003), two
   buttons -- operator setup and calibration -- and two pins that join a serial
   connector.  Ten money lines plus two buttons is twelve inputs; ports A and C
   have sixteen bits between them; A0 is the setup button.  So the calibration
   button is A1, and A2..A5 are the four spare bits with nothing on them.

   What A1 does is then context-dependent, which this software's controls already
   are -- the C key is a credit on a game's start page and the CRC check on the
   menu.  Pressed from the menu, A1 starts a CRC check.  Whether it calibrates
   from somewhere else has not been tried yet.

   Do not read "A2..A5 do nothing" as tested.  They were pulled only during runs
   that rested port A low -- which holds an active-low line asserted from
   power-on, so it can never make the transition anything is looking for -- and
   during runs where the pin was silently ignored.  With the idle levels right,
   nobody has pressed them.  The wire count says they are unconnected; that is a
   prediction, and pulling them one at a time is what would falsify it.
